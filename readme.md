# 🐧 Waving Penguin Project 🐧

Hello there, fellow Penguin Enthusiast! 🎉

Welcome to the coolest (pun intended) project on the block - the Waving Penguin! This isn't just a project, it's a celebration of all things penguin, CSS, and fun. 

## 🎈 What's this all about?

We've got a penguin. A cute, adorable penguin. But this isn't just any penguin. This penguin waves at you! 🐧👋

This project is all about creating a delightful, animated penguin using nothing but HTML and CSS. It's a great way to learn CSS, have fun, and spread some penguin love!

## 📁 Files in the Iceberg

Our penguin lives in two files:

1. `WavingPenguin.html`: This is where our penguin comes to life. It's the structure of our penguin and its icy environment.

2. `styles.css`: This is where our penguin gets its style! From the color of its skin to the wave of its flipper, everything is styled here.

## 🐧 Meet the Penguin

Our penguin is made up of various HTML elements, each styled and positioned to create the shape of a penguin. The waving animation is achieved using CSS keyframes and the `transform` property.

But our penguin isn't alone. It's got a beautiful environment with a sun and mountains, all created with styled HTML elements. The background is a linear gradient, giving the impression of a sky.

## 🎉 Join the Penguin Party!

Want to make the penguin do more than just wave? Feel free to fork this project and add your own animations! Maybe the penguin could blink, jump, or even dance. The possibilities are endless, and it's a great way to practice your CSS skills.

## 🐧💻 Happy Coding!

We hope you enjoy this project as much as we enjoyed creating it. Remember, coding is supposed to be fun. So, keep it cool, keep it fun, and keep it penguin!
